NOTE:-
This application is useful for students like me who eat in private mess, where everyday the amount for food and items we ate were noted in a notebook which they will not show to us. so at the end of month they will calculate bill and ask us to pay amount. Most of the times many students get cheated because of the wrong amounts that they enter daily. so this app is useful to track whatever we ate and finally we can cross check with the bill amount and other details from the app with the bill that they give to us. At the same time we can give comments to the food that we eat daily and then feedback classification will be done automatically in the application and  based on that we can know by the end of month,how many days and on what days espcially we were satisfied and not satisfied with the food.
